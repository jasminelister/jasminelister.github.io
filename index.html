    <h4>Teaching Background and Approach</h4>
    <!--These are my two paragraphs where I go into detail about me-->
    <p>I’m currently in my third year at <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au/">Australian Catholic University (ACU)</a>, working toward a double degree being a Bachelor of Secondary Education alongside a Bachelor of Arts in Design Technologies and Innovations. My major focus is Industrial Technology (timber and metal), and I’ve complemented that with a minor in Food Technologies. Over the course of my studies, I’ve completed three teaching practicum placements that have been instrumental in shaping my practical skills in real classroom environments: first at <a href="https://www.sgcs.com.au/" >St George Christian School</a> in Hurstville, next at <a href="https://sjbcengadine.syd.catholic.edu.au/" >St John Bosco College</a> in Engadine, and most recently at <a href="https://lucasheigh-h.schools.nsw.gov.au/" >Lucas Heights Community School</a></p>

    <p>During each placement, I’ve embraced the opportunity to design hands on lessons and adapt my approaches to suit different learners and school contexts. I enjoy finding creative ways to adapt both Industrial Technology and Food Technologies into meaningful learning experiences, making sure students can see the relevance of what they’re creating. Whether it’s guiding a timber project from concept sketches to final products or teaching practical food preparation skills, I aim to make learning active, engaging, and connected to real world applications. These experiences have helped me refine my ability to plan, deliver, and reflect on lessons that build student confidence, technical skills, and a genuine enthusiasm for learning.</p>

    <!--These are my two paragraphs where I go into detail about me-->
    <p style="font-size: medium;">I’m currently in my third year at <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au/">Australian Catholic University (ACU)</a>, working toward a double degree being a Bachelor of Secondary Education alongside a Bachelor of Arts in Design Technologies and Innovations. My major focus is Industrial Technology (timber and metal), and I’ve complemented that with a minor in Food Technologies. Over the course of my studies, I’ve completed three teaching practicum placements that have been instrumental in shaping my practical skills in real classroom environments: first at <a href="https://www.sgcs.com.au/" >St George Christian School</a> in Hurstville, next at <a href="https://sjbcengadine.syd.catholic.edu.au/" >St John Bosco College</a> in Engadine, and most recently at <a href="https://lucasheigh-h.schools.nsw.gov.au/" >Lucas Heights Community School</a></p>
